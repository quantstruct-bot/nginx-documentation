This guide explains how to edit the configuration of an existing **Instance** in NGINX One Console.

To view and edit an NGINX configuration, follow these steps:

1. On the left menu, select **Instances**.
2. Select the instance you want to view the configuration for.
3. Select the **Configuration** tab to see the current configuration for the NGINX instance.
4. Select **Edit Configuration** to make changes to the current configuration.
5. Make your changes to the configuration files. The config analyzer will let you know if there are any errors.
6. When you are satisfied with the changes, select **Next**.
7. Compare and verify your changes before selecting **Save and Publish** to publish the edited configuration.

Alternatively, you can select **Save Changes As**. In the window that appears, you can set up this instance as a [**Staged Configuration**]({{< ref "/nginx-one/staged-configs/_index.md" >}}).
